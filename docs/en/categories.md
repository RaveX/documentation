Categories are sub-sections within your store to seperate products out into different areas that reduce the amount of viewable products and aid the user to be guided to the correct section of your site. Having all products in one section may work for some stores but once you add more products splitting them up begins to make a lot more sense.

### Creating a Category

Creating a category is a quick and easy process, just follow the steps below.

1. Head to the Categories section within the FireSale sub-navigation.
2. Click the "Create Category" button at the top right.
3. Fill out the form with the details for your category and set the status to live. You can add a category as a sub-category to one that already exists.
4. Click the "Add new category" button beneath the form.
5. The category you have created will appear in the manage categories panel.

### Managing Categories

Categories can be re-ordered in the "Manage Categories Panel" by dragging and dropping. Categories can also be made into a sub-category by this method.

### Editting a Category

To edit a category select it from the manage categories panel. Make any changes in the form and when you are done click the "Edit Category" button beneath the form to save the changes.

### Deleting a Category

The first category, default name of "Categorised", can only be edited and not removed. This is due to when a category is deleted all the products in this category get moved to the default category. It is therefore important to keep this default category around so products are always assigned to at least one category.
